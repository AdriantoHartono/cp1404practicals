# CP1404 Practicals by Adrianto Hartono

## Introduction
Hello, my name is Adrianto Hartono and my major is in IT (Information Technology). 
This is a repository that made to keep all the practical things that I have done in my CP1404 lessons.

## Clean Code
Here is the things that I have learnt about clean code:
- Each function should be able to do one thing and can do it well
- Use descriptive intention to revealing the names
- Need to avoid the use of magic numbers
- Need to be consistent with our function naming convention
